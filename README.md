# 3D Visualizations of VR Biometric Data 
### To Run:
I've added sample SightLab VR data for users to test the visualizations. To run the program:
```# /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.11 ./data.py```

You may need to ```brew install pandas``` for Mac––follow the trail of library dependencies. Additionally, check the location of your Python installation.
